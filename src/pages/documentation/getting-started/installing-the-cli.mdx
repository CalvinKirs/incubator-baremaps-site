# Installing the CLI

In order to run Apache Baremaps, you first need to install Java 17 or a later version.
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) to install and upgrade Java.

To install Apache Baremaps, download and decompress the latest [binary distribution](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/baremaps/).
Then, add the `/bin` directory of the decompressed distribution to your `PATH` environment variable:

```
tar -xzf baremaps-<version>-incubating-bin.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/baremaps/bin
```

Calling the `baremaps` command should now result in an output similar to the following:

```
Usage: baremaps [-V] [COMMAND]
A toolkit for producing vector tiles.
  -V, --version   Print version info.
Commands:
  workflow  Manage a workflow.
  database  Database commands.
  map       Map commands.
  geocoder  Geocoder commands (experimental).
  iploc     IP to location commands (experimental).
  ogcapi    OGC API server (experimental).
```

From here, heads to [Installing PostGIS](/documentation/getting-started/installing-postgis/) if you plan to work with vector tiles.

If you want to work on [Geocoding](/documentation/examples/geocoding/) or [IP to location](/documentation/examples/ip-to-location/), head directly into the related examples.
